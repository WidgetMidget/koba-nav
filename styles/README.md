## Kobatochan Reader Mode

Focuses on making the reading experience more pleasant. You can install it from this repository, or [from here](https://userstyles.org/styles/185935/kobatochan-reader-mode) if you want.

It removes removes side columns, the banner image, centers the chapter content, pads it and expands the reading area, banner logo and search.

## Novels.pl Reader Mode (WIP)

Focuses on making the reading experience more pleasant. You can currently only install it from this repository as I haven't gotten around to uploading it elsewhere.

This does a couple a things. It changes the navbar color on a global scale. And on chapter pages it removes the side panels where you can vote on stuff, see a random story, etc. because they're not relevant to the story you'd be reading, and you can find that on the homepage anyway. The comments are also removed, simply because I've never actually seen anyone comment on this site for some reason. If, for some reason, you happen to notice the comments aren't removed, please make an issue for it and link the page it happened. I was forced to use nth-child, but it *should* be fine. Chapter pages are practically identical.

The reason it's still WIP (Work in progress) is simply because I'm working on making the navbar hide itself when you scroll down, but well, it ain't going as well as I'd hoped. I have a working example, it's just not... practical for end-users.

## Hornyjail for Redditors

Just a fun little thing I made while bored, I'll update it as I go. All it does is send you to hornyjail if you visit any subreddits with nsfw, porn or hentai in it's name as well as some named ones like gonewild, etc.

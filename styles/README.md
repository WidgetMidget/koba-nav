## Kobatochan Reader Mode

Focuses on making the reading experience more pleasant. You can install it from this repository, or [from here](https://userstyles.org/styles/185935/kobatochan-reader-mode) if you want.

It removes removes side columns, the banner image, centers the chapter content, pads it and expands the reading area, banner logo and search.

## Novels.pl Reader Mode

Focuses on making the reading experience more pleasant. You can currently only install it from this repository as I haven't gotten around to uploading it elsewhere.

This does a couple a things. It changes the navbar color and searchbox background color on a global scale. On chapter pages it locks navbar to the top of the page, hides the side panels where you can vote on stuff, see a random story, etc. because they're not relevant to the story you'd be reading and you can find that on the homepage anyway- however! If you happened to like those, you can simply hover over them and they'll reapper like bloody magic! Moving on, the comments are also removed, simply because I've never actually seen anyone comment on this site for some reason.

If, for some reason, you happen to notice the comments aren't removed, please make an issue for it and link the page it happened. I was forced to use nth-child, but it *should* be fine. Chapter pages are practically identical.

## WuxiaWorld Reader Mode

This is something I quickly threw together when I went to their site after a long time and saw how atrocious their touted darkmode is. This style doesn't change much, just makes the site darker in general and makes the left sidebar hidden until hovered.

## ImageChest Comfortable Viewing

I've come across this site through Reddit quite a few times now and it annoys me that the right sidebar is filled with stuff I don't care about while the image is only 66% in size. That makes it somewhat annoying to read text, which is why I made this.

## Webtoons Reader Mode

I was about to read a comic that looked fairly interesting, but the site was making my eyes bleed, so I instead wasted the few moments it took to fix it. Nothing special about this one.

Only thing to note is that I left the navbar at the top of the window in the picture, it is normally hidden by default regardless of if this stylesheet is active or not.

## Active Translations Reader Mode

This is just a quick and dirty stylesheet to make the default layout of a-t.nu be a bit more bearable.

Considering they're changing it often, at the moment, this is subject to change or being archived.

## Hornyjail for Redditors (WIP (basically non-functional))

Just a fun little thing I made while bored, I'll update it as I go. All it does is send you to hornyjail if you visit any subreddits with nsfw, porn or hentai in it's name as well as some named ones like gonewild, etc.

It might still be buggy, so please do make a Issue for it if you notice it not loading correctly.

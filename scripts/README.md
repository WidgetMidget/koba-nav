It's still slightly buggy. It works perfectly well as long as the player isn't in focus. This means that if you click on the video player, you have to click somewhere else that *isn't* the video player before you can use the shortcuts... yeah. I'm working on it.

## Webtoons Terms of Service remover

This one I mostly made because I though it was funny. While I was working on [Webtoons Reader Mode](https://github.com/WidgetMidget/scripts-and-userstyles/raw/master/styles/webtoons_reader-mode.user.css) I was deleting some divs too see what would happen, and lo and behold, the TOS box suddenly popped up.

So I removed it. Because why not.
